This directory contains a simple OpenAL example application. 

It uses GLUT to create the OpenGL context and OpenAL for 3D positional sound. 

The platform is OpenGL for Linux, and the OpenAL libraries and development
headers must be installed.

See http://www.openal.org for more information.

Usage
-----
The application renders a simple sphere head and plays some sound when keys
'a', 's', or 'd' are pressed.

'a' - Play moo (sound source at left ear of mighty mouse)
'A' - Stop moo

's' - Play jingle (sound source in the head) 
'S' - Pause jingle

'd' - Play booyah (sound source at right ear)
'D' - Rewind booyah

'l' - toggle looping

Mouse button 1 controls x/y translation and button2 controls z translation.
Moving the head around changes where sounds seem to emanate from. 

Files
-----

SoundManager.h.cpp
	Sound support

main.cpp
	Main file. Contains the rendering and the event handling


Makefile
--------
type make to compile 

to run, type ./test

Sound Support
-------------
OpenAL is a sound library that mimics OpenGL in spirit.  Like OpenGL, it uses 
contexts that hold state about the current sound environment. 

OpenAL has three basic primitives: buffers, sources, and a listener.  Buffers
represent the sound waveform and can be loaded from WAV files.  

Sources represent sound emitters that play through a queue of buffers, and the
single listener represents the receiver of sound.  Both of these can be
positioned and oriented in 3D space using a right-handed coordinate system like
OpenGL.  Then OpenAL simulates how the sound travels from the sources to the listener.
